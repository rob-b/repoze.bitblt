In next release...

- Re-write rewrite_image_tags to use regular expressions to find/mangle img
  tags. As well aas removing the dependency on lxml this  prevents a whole
  class of bugs where lxml was changing the HTML source too much, see
  http://bugs.repoze.org/issue103. Backwards compatibility for the
  'ImageTransformationMiddleware' class was preserved by leaving the try_xhtml
  argument in place. It is now a no-op.

- Make sure resizing preserves GIF transparency.

  [jinty]

- Fix bug where <![CDATA[ escaped sections would be quoted and the CDATA
  stripped. This causes foulups when quoting Javascript.
  [jinty]

- Properly rewrite <img> tags with pixel (e.g. height="100px") attributes,
  previously the url generated missed the regex resulting in broken images.
  [jinty]

- Don't rewrite <img> tags with percentage sizes, only the browser knows
  how big the images should be. See http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#h-6.6.
  [jinty]

- Use ``unicode_body`` all over to ensure correct
  encoding. [jinty]

- Fixed bug where the leading slash of an absolute URL without the
  FQDN would be wrongly removed. [damien]

- Fixed bug where the quality-parameter would not be coerced to
  integer, required by PIL. [damien]

- Compatibility with Python 2.4. [malthe]

0.7 (released 2009-03-18)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Don't use python 2.6 syntax.
  [seletz]

- Handle empty content bodies, which can occure for redirects.
  [fschulze]

- Added support for xhtml, which allows the inclusion of namespace tags.
  [fschulze]

- Added option to limit the url rewriting to urls below the application url.
  [fschulze]

- Added scaling filter support.
  [fschulze]

- Support image tags with only one of the width or height attributes set.
  [fschulze]

- Fix UnboundLocalError for respones with untransformed image.
  [fschulze]

- Fix importing of PIL. The old way assumed the broken egg installation.
  [fschulze]

  [fschulze]

0.6 (released 2008-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Require to pass in a ``secret`` parameter to configure middleware
  security. [malthe]

0.5 (released 2008-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rewritten URLs are now signed by the middleware to ensure that
  bitblt requests are only crafted by the middleware. This is required
  to shield against DoS attacks. [malthe]

0.4 (released 2008-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed path handling. [malthe]

- Added HTML document processing which scans document for image tags
  and rewrite image ``src`` attribute to include "bitblt" traversing
  directive. This makes it work as an actual middleware, since the
  application semantics are then unchanged. [malthe]

- No longer accept query parameters, but instead require traversing
  directive "/bitblt-<width>x<height>". [malthe]

- Removed functionality to MIME-type convert. [malthe]

0.3 (released 2008-10-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made logic robust to unexpected parameters. [malthe]

- Fixed bug where parameters would be drawn from the WSGI environment. [malthe]

- Added mimetype conversion. [malthe]

0.2 (released 2008-10-08)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed entry point name.

0.1 (released 2008-10-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial release.
